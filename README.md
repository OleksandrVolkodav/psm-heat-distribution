# Plate temperature distribution

This project was made as a part of the PSM (Podstawy symulacji komputerowych / Fundamentals of Computer Simulations) course at [PJATK](https://pja.edu.pl)
It calculates the final temperature distribution in a plate of a given size, with the edges having given constant temperatures.

There is no GUI and the starting temperature values are hard-coded. 
The result is recorded in a .txt file that is supposed to be imported into spreadsheet software to be visualised with conditional formatting.
